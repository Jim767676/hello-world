Doing the tutorial
Total noob to programming, used computers since I was a kid (41 now with old man noises when I get up to prove it) but never got into the language of the machines.  I picked up a raspberry pi and installed Ubuntu-mate on it, been listening to podcasts on programming and find it interesting.  Thanks to all of you on github, sharing your expertise with others.  I hope I can help out someday!
